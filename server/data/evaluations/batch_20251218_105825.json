  "query": "Introduction Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial examples<|cite_0|>, which are generated by adding small, human-imperceptible perturbations to natural images, but completely change the prediction results to DNNs, leading to disastrous implications<|cite_1|>. Since then, numerous methods have been proposed to defend against adversarial examples. Notably,",
