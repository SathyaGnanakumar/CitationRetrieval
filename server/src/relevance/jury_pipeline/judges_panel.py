Scoring Rubric (10 points per side):
- Groundedness in evidence (0-3 points): How well does the answer cite specific data from the context?
- Specificity (0-2 points): Are claims precise with numbers/details vs. vague generalizations?
- Reasoning quality (0-3 points): Is the logic sound and arguments well-structured?
- CGS/G-MAST relevance (0-2 points): Does it address methane abatement technology relevance effectively?
